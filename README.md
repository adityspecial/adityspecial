Got it 👍 You want to adjust your GitHub profile README so the technologies & tools section has a nice GIF/logo banner instead of plain badges (or in addition to them). A common way is to use a tech stack GIF banner (animated icons of your tools) above or alongside the badges.

Here’s an improved version of your README.md with the adjusted technologies GIF:

✨ Thanks for visiting my profile! Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just chat about tech.

✅ This replaces the plain badges with animated / SVG icons (cleaner look).
✅ If you want a GIF banner of all technologies moving in a row, I can generate one for you and embed it in place of the <p align="center"> block.

Do you want me to create a scrolling GIF of your tech stack (all icons moving in a loop)?
